## Here is what the PMEP depth zones stand for, according to the metadata:

### NOTE: The substrate data records the whole name, rather than using the # code

-   Value 0: Landward Zone
-   Value 1: Core Zone (Estuary Overlap)
-   Value 2: Core Zone (Shoreline to -30m), State Waters
-   Value 3: Core Zone (Shoreline to -30m), Federal Waters
-   Value 4: Seaward Zone (-30m to -100m), State Waters
-   Value 5: Seaward Zone (-30m to -100m), Federal Waters
-   Value 6: Deep Shelf or Channel (-100m to -200m), State Waters
-   Value 7: Deep Shelf or Channel (-100m to -200m), Federal WatersLN
-   Value 8: Outside PMEP Score (>-300m) or International Waters

## For the purposes of the PMEP depth zone analysis (when determining overall coverage), I have decided to use the PMEP Zones that are recorded in the substrate data, rather than the biotic data. This is because it is expected for there to be 100% MPA coverage of the different substrate types, where as the biotic data may not contain whole coverage of MPA, given the nature of biota.

## Read in substrate, biota and MPA data

```{r}
# Read in substrate and biotic data
rds.dir <- "/capstone/marinebiomaps/data/rds-files"
substrate_in_mpas <- readRDS(file.path(rds.dir, "substrate_in_mpas.rds"))
biota_in_mpas <- readRDS(file.path(rds.dir, "biota_in_mpas.rds"))
#substrate_outside_mpas <- readRDS(file.path(rds.dir, "substrate_outside_mpas.rds"))

# Read in MPA boundaries data
boundary.dir <- "/capstone/marinebiomaps/data/MPA_boundaries"
mpa_boundaries <- sf::st_read(file.path(boundary.dir, "California_Marine_Protected_Areas_[ds582].shp"))

# Clean and transform MPA boundaries data
mpas <- mpa_boundaries |> 
  clean_names() |> 
  st_transform(mpas, crs = st_crs(substrate_in_mpas)) |> 
  st_make_valid()

```

## In the substrate.rds and biota.rds files, we already have the area of each polygon calculated and stored in a column. So, for much of the statewide analysis, it is ok to use the data with the geometry column dropped!

```{r}
# Drop the geometry of the substrate column. 
substrate_in_mpas_simple <- substrate_in_mpas |> 
  st_drop_geometry() 
```


```{r}
# Take a look at all the PMEP depth zones to verify
unique(substrate_in_mpas_simple$pmep_zone_detail)
```
```{r}
# Rename depth zone variables for searchability/ease - I will bring back more technical names for viz
substrate_in_mpas_simple <- substrate_in_mpas_simple |> 
  mutate(pmep_zone_detail = case_when(
    pmep_zone_detail == "Deep Shelf or Sound (-100m to -200m), State Waters"  ~ "Zone 6",
    pmep_zone_detail == "Outside PMEP Scope (>-200m) or International Waters" ~ "Zone 8",
    pmep_zone_detail == "Seaward Zone (-30m to -100m), Federal"               ~ "Zone 5",
    pmep_zone_detail == "Core Zone (Shoreline to -30m), State Waters"         ~ "Zone 2",
    pmep_zone_detail == "Landward Zone"                                       ~ "Zone 0",
    pmep_zone_detail == "Seaward Zone (-30m to -100m), State Waters"          ~ "Zone 4",
    pmep_zone_detail == "Deep Shelf or Sound (-100m to -200m), Federal"       ~ "Zone 7",
    pmep_zone_detail == "Core Zone (Shoreline to -30m), Federal"              ~ "Zone 3"
  ))


unique(substrate_in_mpas_simple$pmep_zone_detail)
```


#### I am going to calculate the percentages of each MPA that are in each depth zone - using the area column

```{r}
# Total area across all MPAs
total_ha_all_mpas <- sum(substrate_in_mpas_simple$area_ha, na.rm = TRUE)

print(paste0("The total area of Substrate data within California MPAs in Ha: ", round(total_ha_all_mpas, 2)))

# Summarize total area by zone and calculate percentage
zone_areas <- substrate_in_mpas_simple |> 
  group_by(pmep_zone_detail) |> 
  summarize(total_area_per_zone = sum(area_ha, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") |> 
  mutate(percent_of_total = (total_area_per_zone / total_ha_all_mpas) * 100)

# Print formatted output
zone_areas |> 
  arrange(pmep_zone_detail) |> 
  rowwise() |> 
  mutate(print_statement = paste0(
    pmep_zone_detail, 
    ": ", round(total_area_per_zone, 2), " ha (", 
    round(percent_of_total, 2), "% of total)"
  )) |> 
  pull(print_statement) |> 
  cat(sep = "\n")

```
*Note: The total area calculated is higher than the sum of the total added together zone areas, which total 34,766,903.27. This is a 369,000 hectare difference. I will try to figure out why, but am at the moment assuming that there are N/A values, or polygons that are not marked as being part of any zone.*

*Where is zone 1?? not in MPAs apparently...gonna look into that. There is probably some zone 1 outside of mpas- where is it at? Estuaries data, perhaps?*

**NOTE: I ran this analysis with cmecs_sc_name as well, and it was interesting, but a lot of categories with very small #s. This reinforces the decision we made as a team to use the cmecs_sc_category column intead for our analysis, as it groups some of these smaller categories together. I will leave a graph example in the outputs folder of this repository as an illustration of this, but will move on to using cmecs_sc_category unless otherwise instructed.**

### Work on reading in biota to integrate into analysis

**NOTE: There are no biota recorded in zone 0 in this dataset. This is a pretty big gap for this particular visualization, which has depth zones as it base. Could be worth figuring out why zone 0 is absent in this case**
